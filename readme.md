## Text Cleaning Steps
Text cleaning is done first in python. `clean_lines.py' has a string parameter in the code that can be changed to point to either the traning data or a subset thereof. A sample file was created using `head - 1000 > train_sample.csv` and used for development before pointing to the fill sized traning set. It runs quickly enough that I didn't bother to optimize.
